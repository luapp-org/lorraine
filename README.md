The new, multipurpose, optimizing compiler for the Lua++ programming language. Lorraine utilizes LLVM's powerful IR to generate optimized Lua++ bytecode and native code for various architectures. The goal of this project was to provide a safer and more powerful alternative to the existing compiler for the Lua++ programming language.
